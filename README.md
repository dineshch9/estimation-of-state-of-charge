# State of Charge (SoC) estimation of LG Li-ion battery using Deep Learning techniques
State of charge (SOC) estimation is a component of a Battery Management System (BMS). 
Calculating the State of Charge using applied formulae is difficult, getting significant inaccuracies or a loss of SOC accuracy and complexity in the calculation. A data-driven model is one that calculates the SOC using machine learning and deep learning models, which are widely popular and accurate currently. This report focused on the performance of SOC estimation using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using a publicly available dataset and the data, which consists of charging and discharging batteries at various temperatures, are utilized to train the models. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model has achieved a Root Mean Square error in a range of 3-3.4% and a Mean Absolute Error in a range of 2-2.7% at a different temperature to estimate the SOC.

->Developed multiple time series models capable of predicting the SoC with high accuracy. \
->Demonstrated the effectiveness of the selected model by achieving low MAE and RMSE values, indicating precise SoC predictions. \
->Identified important factors influencing SoC, such as time of day, weather conditions, and driving patterns, providing insights for optimizing charging strategies and range management.
